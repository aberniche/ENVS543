## Life of a Generalist

My interest in environmental studies has always been broad, and my experience in the field reflects that

My old professor used to say that nobody wants to be a generalist anymore, they all want to be specialists.

-   Not me!

## Non-Native, Invasive Species

-   My first specific interest
-   I started off interested in invasive reptiles (tegus, iguanas, very Florida)
-   Did research on invasive snails, looking for rat lungworm, *Angiostrongylus cantonensis*
-   Did my senior thesis on non-native, invasive plant species in pine flatwoods

## Plants

-   My thesis about plants in pine flatwoods sparked my interest in plants

-   Used this skill to get a job doing wetland delineations and mitigation

-   I HATE Caesar weed

## Stream and Wetland Ecology

-   My work with plants led to projects with wetlands and streams
-   I became interested in stream health and ecology

## Education

-   I've always had an interest in education
-   Have been a camp counselor, environmental educator, and TA in undergrad and grad school
-   Now I get to work with students through the [Hutton Program](www.hutton.fisheries.org)

## Environmental Justice

-   Through my current job at AFS, I am the coordinator of our DEIJA work
-   I've always been interested in environmental justice, but my work at AFS has amplified the importance of this work to me
